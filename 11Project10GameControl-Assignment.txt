Copy the basicTemplate folder and rename it as prj10GameControl-Assignment, 
	then go to it in the command prompt and issue command "npm install"
	
this assignment covers all the concepts that have been learned from project 1 to project 9. 

following tasks needs to be completed for it. 

1. Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
2. The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
3. When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
4. The event should be listenable from outside the component
5. When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
6. A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
7. Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
8. Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components

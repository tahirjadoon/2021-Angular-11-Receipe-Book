A sample project to show how local references is used

Open src\index.html file in the root and change the title to "Project 6 Local References Use"

Check cockpit component and html for more details. 

local references can only be used inside the html template and not in the component. 

local references is created with # and then the name. In the following case #serverNameInput will hold a refrence to the whole of the html element. 
	<input type="text" class="form-control" #serverNameInput>
	
and then the button will pass it to the component 
	<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="onAddServer(serverNameInput)">Add Server</button>

and then change the onAddServer method to get the local reference and use its value. 	
	onAddServer(nameInput: HTMLInputElement) {
		this.serverCreated.emit({serverName: nameInput.value, serverContent: this.newServerContent});
	}
